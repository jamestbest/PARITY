He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, <i> Ichigo</i>. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.<br /><br />Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's <i>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</i> is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.","book":{"$id":58784475,"num_pages":401},"author_name":"Gabrielle Zevin","isbn":"","user_name":"James","user_rating":4,"user_read_at":"Thu, 28 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000","user_date_added":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:54:21 -0800","user_date_created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 03:32:28 -0700","user_shelves":"","user_review":"","average_rating":4.18,"book_published":2022,"description":"\n      <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss\"><img alt=\"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1636978687l/58784475._SY75_.jpg\" /></a><br/>\n                                      author: Gabrielle Zevin<br/>\n                                      name: James<br/>\n                                      average rating: 4.18<br/>\n                                      book published: 2022<br/>\n                                      rating: 4<br/>\n                                      read at: 2023/12/28<br/>\n                                      date added: 2024/01/23<br/>\n                                      shelves: <br/>\n                                      review: <br/><br/>\n                                      "},{"guid":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5855564866?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:54:19 -0800","title":"Artificial Condition (The Murderbot Diaries, #2)","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5855564866?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","book_id":36223860,"book_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1505590203l/36223860._SY75_.jpg","book_small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1505590203l/36223860._SY75_.jpg","book_medium_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1505590203l/36223860._SX98_.jpg","book_large_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1505590203l/36223860._SY475_.jpg","book_description":"Alternate cover of ISBN 9781250186928.

Clouds of war are gathering over a fogbound London. Twenty-eight year old Jack is poor, lonely, and desperate to change his life, so when he's offered the chance to join an Arctic expedition, he jumps at it. Spirits are high as the ship leaves Norway: five men and eight huskies, crossing the Barents Sea by the light of the midnight sun. At last they reach the remote, uninhabited bay where they will camp for the next year, Gruhuken, but the Arctic summer is brief. As night returns to claim the land, Jack feels a creeping unease. One by one, his companions are forced to leave. He faces a stark choice: stay or go. Soon he will see the last of the sun, as the polar night engulfs the camp in months of darkness. Soon he will reach the point of no return--when the sea will freeze, making escape impossible. Gruhuken is not uninhabited. Jack is not alone. Something walks there in the dark...","book":{"$id":8350864,"num_pages":246},"author_name":"Michelle Paver","isbn":1409123782,"user_name":"James","user_rating":4,"user_read_at":"Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000","user_date_added":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:54:06 -0800","user_date_created":"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 18:50:31 -0800","user_shelves":"","user_review":"","average_rating":3.99,"book_published":2010,"description":"\n      <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8350864-dark-matter?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss\"><img alt=\"Dark Matter: A Ghost Story\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1504563569l/8350864._SY75_.jpg\" /></a><br/>\n                                      author: Michelle Paver<br/>\n                                      name: James<br/>\n                                      average rating: 3.99<br/>\n                                      book published: 2010<br/>\n                                      rating: 4<br/>\n                                      read at: 2024/01/11<br/>\n                                      date added: 2024/01/23<br/>\n                                      shelves: <br/>\n                                      review: <br/><br/>\n                                      "},{"guid":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5694847736?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:54:04 -0800","title":"Mort (Discworld, #4; Death, #1)","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5694847736?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","book_id":386372,"book_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388181166l/386372._SY75_.jpg","book_small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388181166l/386372._SY75_.jpg","book_medium_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388181166l/386372._SY160_.jpg","book_large_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388181166l/386372.jpg","book_description":"Death comes to us all.

Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming....</b><br /><br />Nora Stephens’ life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby.<br /><br />Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute.<br /><br />If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.","book":{"$id":58690308,"num_pages":377},"author_name":"Emily Henry","isbn":"","user_name":"James","user_rating":5,"user_read_at":"Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000","user_date_added":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:53:57 -0800","user_date_created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2023 03:22:18 -0700","user_shelves":"","user_review":"","average_rating":4.13,"book_published":2022,"description":"\n      <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58690308-book-lovers?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss\"><img alt=\"Book Lovers\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1638867089l/58690308._SY75_.jpg\" /></a><br/>\n                                      author: Emily Henry<br/>\n                                      name: James<br/>\n                                      average rating: 4.13<br/>\n                                      book published: 2022<br/>\n                                      rating: 5<br/>\n                                      read at: 2023/07/28<br/>\n                                      date added: 2024/01/23<br/>\n                                      shelves: <br/>\n                                      review: <br/><br/>\n                                      "},{"guid":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5975988484?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:53:56 -0800","title":"Geometry for Ocelots","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5975988484?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","book_id":58245377,"book_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1622651140l/58245377._SY75_.jpg","book_small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1622651140l/58245377._SY75_.jpg","book_medium_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1622651140l/58245377._SY160_.jpg","book_large_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1622651140l/58245377._SY475_.jpg","book_description":"It is the end of history and all is known, or will be soon.

Knights who fly too near find their magic suddenly drained, so the voyage must be by sea.<br /><br />Years ago, shipowner Rysn Ftori lost the use of her legs but gained the companionship of Chiri-Chiri, a stormlight-ingesting larkin, a species once thought extinct. Now Rysn’s pet is ill, and any hope for Chiri-Chiri’s recovery can be found only at the ancestral home of the larkin: Akinah. With the help of Lopen, the formerly one-armed windrunner, Rysn must accept Navani’s quest and sail into the perilous storm from which no one has returned alive. If the crew cannot uncover the secrets of the hidden island city before the wrath of its ancient guardians falls upon them, the fate of Roshar and the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.","book":{"$id":60521558,"num_pages":249},"author_name":"Brandon Sanderson","isbn":1803361069,"user_name":"James","user_rating":5,"user_read_at":"Tue, 2 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000","user_date_added":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:53:53 -0800","user_date_created":"Mon, 01 Jan 2024 13:09:31 -0800","user_shelves":"","user_review":"","average_rating":4.23,"book_published":2020,"description":"\n      <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60521558-dawnshard?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss\"><img alt=\"Dawnshard\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1646037304l/60521558._SY75_.jpg\" /></a><br/>\n                                      author: Brandon Sanderson<br/>\n                                      name: James<br/>\n                                      average rating: 4.23<br/>\n                                      book published: 2020<br/>\n                                      rating: 5<br/>\n                                      read at: 2024/01/02<br/>\n                                      date added: 2024/01/23<br/>\n                                      shelves: <br/>\n                                      review: <br/><br/>\n                                      "},{"guid":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5629407113?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:53:51 -0800","title":"Project Hail Mary","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5629407113?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","book_id":54493401,"book_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597695864l/54493401._SY75_.jpg","book_small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597695864l/54493401._SY75_.jpg","book_medium_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597695864l/54493401._SX98_.jpg","book_large_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597695864l/54493401.jpg","book_description":"Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.<br /><br />Except that right now, he doesn’t know that.

Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Bender’s fate—whatever the cost.<br /><br />But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bob’s descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore.

From the bestselling author who completed Robert Jordan's epic Wheel of Time series comes a new, original creation that matches anything else in modern fantasy for epic scope, thrilling imagination, superb characters and sheer addictiveness. In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive series, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe whose numbers are as great as their thirst for vengeance. The Alethi armies commanded by Dalinar Kholin won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, and now its destruction sweeps the world and its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the true horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that their newly kindled anger may be wholly justified. Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths the dark secrets lurking in its depths. And gradually realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put Dalinar's blood-soaked past aside and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not avert the end of civilization.

But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble.<br /><br />They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.<br /><br />Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.<br /><br />Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol - unless the Others arrive first.","book":{"$id":35506021,"num_pages":336},"author_name":"Dennis E.

But that's the only part of the plan that's still in one piece.

Instead he's become a sky god to a primitive native species, the only hope for getting humanity to a new home, and possibly the only thing that can prevent every living thing in the local sphere from ending up as dinner.","book":{"$id":33395557,"num_pages":9},"author_name":"Dennis E.

There are places to go, books to read, and movies to watch. So it's a little unfair when he gets himself killed crossing the street. <br /> <br />Bob wakes up a century later to find that corpsicles have been declared to be without rights, and he is now the property of the state. He has been uploaded into computer hardware and is slated to be the controlling AI in an interstellar probe looking for habitable planets. The stakes are high: no less than the first claim to entire worlds. If he declines the honor, he'll be switched off, and they'll try again with someone else. If he accepts, he becomes a prime target. There are at least three other countries trying to get their own probes launched first, and they play dirty. <br /> <br />The safest place for Bob is in space, heading away from Earth at top speed. Or so he thinks. Because the universe is full of nasties, and trespassers make them mad - very mad.","book":{"$id":32109569,"num_pages":383},"author_name":"Dennis E.

These teens must master the “art” of taking life, knowing that the consequence of failure could mean losing their own.<br /><br /><i>An alternate cover edition of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57010856-scythe\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ISBN: 9781442472426</a></i>","book":{"$id":28954189,"num_pages":435},"author_name":"Neal Shusterman","isbn":"","user_name":"James","user_rating":5,"user_read_at":"Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000","user_date_added":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:53:27 -0800","user_date_created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 03:32:55 -0700","user_shelves":"","user_review":"","average_rating":4.32,"book_published":2016,"description":"\n      <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28954189-scythe?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss\"><img alt=\"Scythe (Arc of a Scythe, #1)\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1456172676l/28954189._SY75_.jpg\" /></a><br/>\n                                      author: Neal Shusterman<br/>\n                                      name: James<br/>\n                                      average rating: 4.32<br/>\n                                      book published: 2016<br/>\n                                      rating: 5<br/>\n                                      read at: 2023/08/23<br/>\n                                      date added: 2024/01/23<br/>\n                                      shelves: <br/>\n                                      review: <br/><br/>\n                                      "},{"guid":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5975987400?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 12:53:25 -0800","title":"Words of Radiance, Part 1 (The Stormlight Archive #2, Part 1 of 2)","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5975987400?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","book_id":60475860,"book_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1645555904l/60475860._SY75_.jpg","book_small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1645555904l/60475860._SY75_.jpg","book_medium_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1645555904l/60475860._SY160_.jpg","book_large_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1645555904l/60475860._SY475_.jpg","book_description":"The natural heir to Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series hit No.1 in the US and No.2 in the UK with the hardback release of the massive second volume, WORDS OF RADIANCE.

Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground.

And the Voidbringers followed ...<br /><br />They came against man ten thousand times. To help them cope, the Almighty gave men powerful suits of armor and mystical weapons, known as Shardblades. Led by ten angelic Heralds and ten orders of knights known as Radiants, mankind finally won.<br /><br />Or so the legends say.

It is the definitive reference guide, now in a second edition. Although the first edition was written in 1978, it continues to be a worldwide best-seller. This second edition brings the classic original up to date to include the ANSI standard. <br /><br /> From the Preface: <br /> We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.  <p> As we said in the first preface to the first edition, C \"wears well as one's experience with it grows.\" With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you to learn C and use it well.</p>","book":{"$id":515601,"num_pages":272},"author_name":"Brian W.
